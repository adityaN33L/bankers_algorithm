# Bankers Algorithm Implementation  
  
The **banker’s algorithm** is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.    

#### Run Command:
